## Authority integration

The public integration branch builds on `f436a1938def7370bf54d99d4f40606dff3f87ce`,
the documentation-only continuation of green source `1e3cf48`.
It preserves the PR #1 → #2 → #3 stack and brings the verified authority
candidates together with focused cross-component regressions. A processor
worker is detached, drained and reopened against the same RocksDB path.
An import token that observes a durable revision replacement stays revoked
until its worker releases the reservation.

See the [dated integration report](docs/development/PHASE6_AUTHORITY_INTEGRATION_2026-11-08.md).
Draft [PR #4](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/pull/4) is stacked on PR #3 at `f64839c`.
The exact implementation head is `c44805170fb44dcd51e645e50341072c2a38e1e3` on
`feature/phase6-authority-integration-20261108`.
[PR run 42500808732](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42500808732) is the authoritative combined run
and passed all eight jobs. Both focused regressions passed, along with
1,559 workspace tests (25 skipped), 32 no-asm tests, and strict Clippy.
The superseded
[push run 42500792929](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42500792929) was cancelled by the PR run.
PR #4 retains its tested implementation head.

## Inactive staging coordinator

The [staging coordinator report](docs/development/PHASE6_STAGING_COORDINATOR_2026-11-08.md) describes the next stacked
candidate. One processor-owned session covers proof, SMT, shielded and
UTXO batches. A failed or interrupted component keeps readiness closed.
Authenticated completion issues the exact lease used by the inactive
promotion gate.

Restart on a database with descendants pins committed virtual and
selected-chain state, verifies the applied tip and pruning-point
shielded commitments, and checks the post-pruning nullifier projection.
Unavailable proof, a missing authenticated tip child or an inconsistent
committed view leaves authority closed.

## Candidate validation

[Draft PR #5](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/pull/5) is stacked on PR #4.
The source checkpoint is `4eb422549fa822b804968f9c2911018b518286f0` on `feature/phase6-staging-coordinator-20261108`.
[PR run 42506751029](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42506751029) passed all eight jobs.
All four focused regressions and 1,561 native workspace tests passed
(25 skipped). The no-asm suite passed 32 tests. Formatting and strict
Clippy passed.
The same-SHA [push run 42506746483](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42506746483) was superseded.

[Run 42503818037](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42503818037)
reported the missing `kaspa_hashes::Hash` test import in Check and
Clippy. Its correction `6e5c4ae` passed both jobs and five other platform
and build checks, with seven of eight jobs passing overall in
[run 42504801081](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42504801081).
The focused suite passed three of four regressions, including committed
descendant recovery. The staging cancellation fixture expected an absent
anticone row, but consensus initialization creates it. The corrected test
requires both scoped rows to equal their pre-operation bytes after the
rejected batch. The staging and restart implementation remains unchanged.

## Typed UTXO adapter

[Draft PR #6](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/pull/6)
is stacked on PR #5. The original typed chunk source
`2afec236ac42e03bdeaf21d06c0191a70bba99f7` passed all eight jobs in
[run 42509613211](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42509613211).
Four focused regressions, 1,561 native workspace tests (25 skipped), and
32 no-asm tests passed.

## Owner-bound completion and promotion receiver

The [November 10 report](docs/development/PHASE6_PROMOTION_RECEIVER_2026-11-10.md)
records the continuation on the PR #6 branch. The typed UTXO completion
worker verifies committed UTXO rows before publishing the position and
stable flag in the same authority-checked batch. The consensus manager has
a separate verified commit entry point. It asks the exact staging receiver
to consume the completion receipt before swapping consensus. The real
receipt issuer and receiver remain inactive test code pending production
wiring. The initial source `bc393eae2d9bd03df2f684d06e53ec78e865da60` reached
[run 42894808941](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42894808941).
Formatting reported two line wraps in the regression test. The correction
`72af6c818be80c8a0365036e23c4744da8b4bf94` passed formatting in
[run 42895086028](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42895086028).
Check and strict Clippy also passed. The full workspace result was
pending when the follow-up source was prepared.

## IBD proof receipt and promotion recheck

IBD now passes the exact proof accepted by the defender to the staging
receiver in a typed receipt. This uses the existing validation and
application logic. The inactive promotion commit now independently
rechecks the committed UTXO, SMT, proof, and shielded evidence before
spending the lease. A regression removes committed UTXOs after receipt
issuance and requires the write to fail with readiness closed. The
follow-up Actions run is pending.

## Owner-bound proof application

The candidate on `feature/phase6-owned-proof-import-20261110` builds on draft
[PR #6](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/pull/6)
at `42476e2661b5e579f665407d18352a36af09c301`. The baseline
[run 42896198192](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42896198192)
had passed six jobs at candidate preparation. The Linux release build and
workspace Test Suite were still running. The candidate uses a separate
branch to preserve that run.

The [dated report](docs/development/PHASE6_OWNED_PROOF_IMPORT_2026-11-10.md) records the receiver-owned proof worker.
The coordinator binds the defender's exact receipt before its first
database write and keeps the proof evidence through completion. Both IBD
proof branches use the same proof and history application entry point.
The coordinator-specific entry point remains inactive. The initial proof candidate `863ec4fd7293fa3c54916b229c0f9c5f9a6ba659` passed formatting and Check in
[run 42897872282](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42897872282)
before the streaming follow-up.

The streaming follow-up also drains the SMT and shielded writer on a
stream error before returning to the staging caller. A focused test
covers error propagation only after worker release. Combined CI is in progress.

The combined source is `ecf0aacafa9cfc3028eb363021c5aebf733c62e1` on
`feature/phase6-owned-proof-import-20261110`. Its exact validation is
[run 42898217206](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42898217206).
The unchanged PR #6 baseline
[run 42896198192](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42896198192)
passed all eight jobs at `42476e2661b5e579f665407d18352a36af09c301`.
It passed six focused regressions, 1,563 native workspace tests
(25 skipped), and 32 no-asm tests. Combined run 42898217206 passed all eight jobs.

## Production IBD preview

See [the dated development report](docs/development/PHASE6_PRODUCTION_IMPORT_PREVIEW_2026-11-10.md). The continuation adds a
default-off `kaspa-consensus/phase6-staging-preview` feature for an
isolated Simnet staging receiver. It admits the exact defender-accepted proof
before writes, carries the same reservation through production IBD
workers, and verifies durable virtual UTXOs before verified promotion.
[Draft PR #7](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/pull/7)
is stacked on the green `feature/phase6-owned-proof-import-20261110`
branch at `ecf0aacafa9cfc3028eb363021c5aebf733c62e1`. The PR head is
`ebcb3ce00043b0d3f73a2ee7508f0cc68a363a69` on `feature/phase6-production-import-preview-20261110`.
The authoritative [run 42909699012](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42909699012)
is pending. The same-SHA push run 42909689791 was superseded. The green
parent passed eight focused regressions, 1,565 workspace tests (25
skipped), and 32 no-asm tests in run 42898217206.

## Next executable task

Check the focused two-daemon Simnet preview test
`authority_integration_production_preview_promotes_shielded_ibd` in
run 42909699012. If it passes, extend the peer harness with interruption
during each state stream and restart before promotion. The focused suite
also covers manager drain, receipt rejection, stale durable authority,
and incomplete virtual UTXOs.
Review the supported preview builds before making any decision about
replacing the default promotion path.
