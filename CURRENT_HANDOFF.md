## Phase 6 continuation

- The [authenticated import candidate](docs/development/PHASE6_AUTHENTICATED_IMPORT_2026-11-08.md)
  at `a6dd7fe` passed [all eight jobs](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42489992639),
  1,552 native tests with 25 skipped, and 32 no-asm tests. The readiness
  reopen, failed-import reservation, abrupt WAL recovery, and shielded
  proof and nullifier regressions passed.

  with 1,553 native tests, 25 skipped, and 32 no-asm tests. The staging
  cleanup and both abrupt WAL recovery regressions passed.

  adapter to the owner created by the processor itself. Its exact
  [tested source](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/commit/1e3cf487d66da46dfb35b04c027f1126e923070b)
  passed [all eight jobs](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42493738676),
  1,557 native tests with 25 skipped, and 32 no-asm tests.

## Authority integration

The public integration branch builds on `f436a1938def7370bf54d99d4f40606dff3f87ce`,
the documentation-only continuation of green source `1e3cf48`.
It preserves the PR #1 → #2 → #3 stack and brings the verified authority
candidates together with focused cross-component regressions. A processor
worker is detached, drained and reopened against the same RocksDB path.
An import token that observes a durable revision replacement stays revoked
until its worker releases the reservation.

See the [dated integration report](docs/development/PHASE6_AUTHORITY_INTEGRATION_2026-11-08.md).
Draft [PR #4](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/pull/4) is stacked on PR #3 at `f64839c`.
The exact implementation head is `c44805170fb44dcd51e645e50341072c2a38e1e3` on
`feature/phase6-authority-integration-20261108`.
[PR run 42500808732](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42500808732) is the authoritative combined run
and passed all eight jobs. Both focused regressions passed, along with
1,559 workspace tests (25 skipped), 32 no-asm tests, and strict Clippy.
The superseded
[push run 42500792929](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42500792929) was cancelled by the PR run.
PR #4 retains its tested implementation head.

## Inactive staging coordinator

The [staging coordinator report](docs/development/PHASE6_STAGING_COORDINATOR_2026-11-08.md) describes the next stacked
candidate. One processor-owned session covers proof, SMT, shielded and
UTXO batches. A failed or interrupted component keeps readiness closed.
Authenticated completion issues the exact lease used by the inactive
promotion gate.

Restart on a database with descendants pins committed virtual and
selected-chain state, verifies the applied tip and pruning-point
shielded commitments, and checks the post-pruning nullifier projection.
Unavailable proof, a missing authenticated tip child or an inconsistent
committed view leaves authority closed.

## Candidate validation

[Draft PR #5](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/pull/5) is stacked on PR #4.
The source checkpoint is `4eb422549fa822b804968f9c2911018b518286f0` on `feature/phase6-staging-coordinator-20261108`.
[PR run 42506751029](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42506751029) passed all eight jobs.
All four focused regressions and 1,561 native workspace tests passed
(25 skipped). The no-asm suite passed 32 tests. Formatting and strict
Clippy passed.
The same-SHA [push run 42506746483](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42506746483) was superseded.

[Run 42503818037](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42503818037)
reported the missing `kaspa_hashes::Hash` test import in Check and
Clippy. Its correction `6e5c4ae` passed both jobs and five other platform
and build checks, with seven of eight jobs passing overall in
[run 42504801081](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42504801081).
The focused suite passed three of four regressions, including committed
descendant recovery. The staging cancellation fixture expected an absent
anticone row, but consensus initialization creates it. The corrected test
requires both scoped rows to equal their pre-operation bytes after the
rejected batch. The staging and restart implementation remains unchanged.

## Typed UTXO adapter

[Draft PR #6](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/pull/6)
is stacked on PR #5. The original typed chunk source
`2afec236ac42e03bdeaf21d06c0191a70bba99f7` passed all eight jobs in
[run 42509613211](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42509613211).
Four focused regressions, 1,561 native workspace tests (25 skipped), and
32 no-asm tests passed.

## Owner-bound completion and promotion receiver

The [November 10 report](docs/development/PHASE6_PROMOTION_RECEIVER_2026-11-10.md)
records the continuation on the PR #6 branch. The typed UTXO completion
worker verifies committed UTXO rows before publishing the position and
stable flag in the same authority-checked batch. The consensus manager has
a separate verified commit entry point. It asks the exact staging receiver
to consume the completion receipt before swapping consensus. The real
receipt issuer and receiver remain inactive test code pending production
wiring. The initial source `bc393eae2d9bd03df2f684d06e53ec78e865da60` reached
[run 42894808941](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42894808941).
Formatting reported two line wraps in the regression test. The correction
`72af6c818be80c8a0365036e23c4744da8b4bf94` passed formatting in
[run 42895086028](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42895086028).
Check and strict Clippy also passed. The full workspace result was
pending when the follow-up source was prepared.

## IBD proof receipt and promotion recheck

IBD now passes the exact proof accepted by the defender to the staging
receiver in a typed receipt. This uses the existing validation and
application logic. The inactive promotion commit now independently
rechecks the committed UTXO, SMT, proof, and shielded evidence before
spending the lease. A regression removes committed UTXOs after receipt
issuance and requires the write to fail with readiness closed. The
follow-up Actions run is pending.

## Owner-bound proof application

The candidate on `feature/phase6-owned-proof-import-20261110` builds on draft
[PR #6](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/pull/6)
at `42476e2661b5e579f665407d18352a36af09c301`. The baseline
[run 42896198192](https://github.com/DeepFriedBlockchains/KascadeNetwork/actions/runs/42896198192)
had passed six jobs at candidate preparation. The Linux release build and
workspace Test Suite were still running. The candidate uses a separate
branch to preserve that run.

The [dated report](docs/development/PHASE6_OWNED_PROOF_IMPORT_2026-11-10.md) records the receiver-owned proof worker.
The coordinator binds the defender's exact receipt before its first
database write and keeps the proof evidence through completion. Both IBD
proof branches use the same proof and history application entry point.
The coordinator-specific entry point remains inactive. Candidate Actions
validation is pending.

## Next executable task

Validate the new proof worker against the real pruning proof validator
and receiver. Then pass the owned coordinator through
`sync_and_validate_pruning_proof` and into the SMT and shielded streaming
workers. Keep the detached-worker permit and pruning guard alive until
the worker exits. Complete UTXO finalization and route the completed
receipt through `StagingConsensus::commit_verified` before replacing
legacy IBD promotion.
